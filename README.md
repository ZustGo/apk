Respected Sir,
We had a discussion regarding the outstation and rental module to be included in the current ZustGo app. To execute the process efficiently we need a prototype of the app from the design team approved by Mr. Singh and Mr. Diptiman, after which we can start the development process. The Android team consists of:
1) Rajarshi Das
2) Subhasis Mukhopadhyay
3) Sayak Dhar
4) Debarghya Mukherjee

We would require 3 systems with the following configuration.
Processor:Â Intel Core i5-8400 BX80684I58400 Processor (https://www.amazon.in/Intel-Core-i5-8400-BX80684I58400-Processor/dp/B0759FGJ3Q/ref=sr_1_1?s=computers&ie=UTF8&qid=1528265592&sr=1-1&keywords=i5+8th+generation+processor) and respective motherboard.
RAM: 16GB DDR4 2400MHz
